[can-you-dogma-a-splayed-card-that-is-not-the-top-c](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2496040/can-you-dogma-a-splayed-card-that-is-not-the-top-c)

> Can you dogma a splayed card that is not the top card?

No, you can only dogma top cards.
You can only target the top card of each color with a Dogma action.

[translation-dogma](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3301705/translation-dogma)

> The 1st dogma says "You may meld all the cards in your score pile. If you meld one, you must meld them all."
2nd dogma says "If each top card on your board has a (crown icon), claim the World achievement". If I choose not to meld at all using the top dogma since it says "may" can I still use the 2nd dogma? Or since I didn't meld any cards using the 1st dogma am I out of luck using #2?

Unless noted otherwise, the dogmas are independent of each other. You can still activate the 2nd dogma even if you didn't meld anything from your score pile.

[gunpowder-vs-feudalism](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1012554/gunpowder-vs-feudalism)

> On Gunpowder the second action starts with "If any card etc."
On Feudalism the second action starts with "You may etc".
Does this mean on Gunpowder the second action is shared by all players who have the required symbols and on Feudalism the second action only applies to the player that played the card since the action starts with "you"?

They're both shared. All non-demand dogma effects are shared by players that match the initiator's symbol count.

[do-you-do-the-second-dogma-action-on-tools-if-as-a](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2576355/do-you-do-the-second-dogma-action-on-tools-if-as-a)

> Tools allow you to return 3 cards to draw and meld a 3. By chance I draw a blue 3 which means I must meld it on top of tools. Does it mean that the second dogma action that I was planning to do with tools (return another 3 I had in my hand to draw three 1 cards) is forfeit?

A dogma action is taken to its completion under the board state at the start of the action, which means covering doesn't matter, and players who share the first part can share any additional parts even if their icon count changes. From the rules "Finally, in the occasion the card you selected with the dogma action is covered up or removed during part of the action, you still complete all effects on the card."

[empty-hand-can-i-still-discard-all-my-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/596552/empty-hand-can-i-still-discard-all-my-cards)

> If a dogma says: Discard your hand and draw 3 from age 6. Can I do that without any cards in my hand?

Yes. You can do as much Dogma as you can.

[enteprise-who-chooses-which-top-card-to-transfer](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1092242/enteprise-who-chooses-which-top-card-to-transfer)

> The Enterprise card includes the effect "I demand you transfer a top non-purple card with a CROWN from your board to my board! If you do, draw and meld a 4." In the case where there are multiple top non-purple cards with crowns on the opponents board, who chooses which one to transfer -- the demander or the demander's opponent? I.e. the thief or the victim?

The victim Chooses. "I demand YOU transfer" means your opponent is doing the transfer and they chooses whichever card to transfer.

[sharing-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2164904/sharing-question)

> If my opponent activates a dogma effect of a card, and i have more of the required symbol than he does, do i have to share the action even if i dont want to?

Sharing in general is not optional. However, if part of the dogma is written "you may" then you do not have to perform that part of the dogma

[when-is-eligibility-to-perform-a-dogma-determined](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/573827/when-is-eligibility-to-perform-a-dogma-determined)

> what happens if someone gets a final achievement in the middle of the actions? Does the game end then, or does it continue until the end of that players turn?

The (standard) game end is that the person who gets the 4/5/6-th achievement wins. As soon as you have the appropriate number of achievements, you win.

[vaccination](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1556261/vaccination)

> If Card says "I demand you return all the lowest cards in your score pile." What card values should the player affected by this dogma consider as lowest cards?

"Lowest cards" means "Lowest age". So if your pile has ages 1, 1, 2, 5, then you'd return the two 1's. If it has 3, 5, 9, 10, then you'd return the single age 3 card.

[rules-clarifications](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/937700/rules-clarifications)

> Are tucked cards (yours and other players') public information? Can we look at other players tucked cards to check what happens if they splay?

You can look at your own tucked cards, but you can't look at other players tucked cards. 

> When a card says "the highest card" and you have multiple highest cards, do you choose one or take all of them?

If it says "the highest card", the player holding the cards chooses. If it says "all the highest cards",they all go.
