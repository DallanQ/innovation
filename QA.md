> Can you dogma a splayed card that is not the top card?

No, you can only dogma top cards.
You can only target the top card of each color with a Dogma action.

----
page 5

As you play, you will accumulate cards of five different colors in an area in front of you called your board. Your most important cards are the top cards of each color, as they can be activated for their effects through the Dogma action.

----
Page 7

Dogma: The core action of Innovation. It allows you to activate one of the top cards on your board for its game effect. These effects do many useful things, including placing cards in your score pile.

----
page 9

When you take a Dogma action, choose one of your top cards to activate. This represents your civilization focusing on one of the innovations you have discovered. The Dogma action is the central mechanic of the game.

[translation-dogma](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3301705/translation-dogma)

> The 1st dogma says "You may meld all the cards in your score pile. If you meld one, you must meld them all."
2nd dogma says "If each top card on your board has a (crown icon), claim the World achievement". If I choose not to meld at all using the top dogma since it says "may" can I still use the 2nd dogma? Or since I didn't meld any cards using the 1st dogma am I out of luck using #2?

Unless noted otherwise, the dogmas are independent of each other. You can still activate the 2nd dogma even if you didn't meld anything from your score pile.

----
Page 10

If you can only perform part of an effect, do as much as you can and ignore the rest. A demand requiring your three highest cards would take your entire hand if you only have two cards, for example. An effect that exchanges your hand and score pile still takes place if one of the two is empty. You are allowed to use the Dogma action on a card that will cause nothing at all to happen.

----

Do as much as you can: If you can’t do everything a dogma effect instructs you to do, then do all the things you are able to and ignore the rest.

> On Gunpowder the second action starts with "If any card etc."
On Feudalism the second action starts with "You may etc".
Does this mean on Gunpowder the second action is shared by all players who have the required symbols and on Feudalism the second action only applies to the player that played the card since the action starts with "you"?

They're both shared. All non-demand dogma effects are shared by players that match the initiator's symbol count.

----
Page 14

In this example, I have Oars and want to use its Demand effect. Since I have three of its featured icon (icon of a castle) compared to my opponent’s one, I read aloud the effect. Sadly, they have no matching cards in their hand, so nothing happens.

However, Oars’ second effect (a non-demand dogma effect) reads “If no cards were transferred due to this demand, draw a 1,” and so I am able to salvage a card draw out of the situation. This non-demand effect would be shared by any eligible players.

> The Enterprise card includes the effect "I demand you transfer a top non-purple card with a CROWN from your board to my board! If you do, draw and meld a 4." In the case where there are multiple top non-purple cards with crowns on the opponents board, who chooses which one to transfer -- the demander or the demander's opponent? I.e. the thief or the victim?

The victim Chooses. "I demand YOU transfer" means your opponent is doing the transfer and they chooses whichever card to transfer.

----
Page 9

Some effects are demand effects. They are in darker boxes and all start with “I demand.” These effects are attacks, and you read them aloud to make it clear what your opponents must do. In clockwise order, each opponent follows the instructions. Opponents who have at least as many of the featured icon as you ignore demand effects.

[sharing-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2164904/sharing-question)

> If my opponent activates a dogma effect of a card, and i have more of the required symbol than he does, do i have to share the action even if i dont want to?

Sharing in general is not optional. However, if part of the dogma is written "you may" then you do not have to perform that part of the dogma

----
Page 9

Before you execute an effect, each other player who is eligible to share must also use it. Starting to your left and going clockwise, each of them follows the effect’s instructions. Then you perform them. If the card has additional effects, repeat this process, including sharing, for each effect.

[when-is-eligibility-to-perform-a-dogma-determined](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/573827/when-is-eligibility-to-perform-a-dogma-determined)

> what happens if someone gets a final achievement in the middle of the actions? Does the game end then, or does it continue until the end of that players turn?

The (standard) game end is that the person who gets the 4/5/6-th achievement wins. Regular achievements can only be claimed as an action, so clearly there's no problem with these. Special achievements are claimed IMMEDIATELY (even if the matching condition is transient.
For example: you're melding multiple cards and you reach the condition after melding one, and the lose the condition after melding the second, you still get to claim the special achievement)
So, as soon as you have the appropriate number of achievements, you win.

----
Page 17

To win, you need to claim a number of achievements depending on how many players are in the game. For a two player or team game, 6 achievements. For three players, 5 achievements, and for four players, 4 achievements. These can be a mixture of regular and special achievements.

If nobody has won yet and a card higher than age 10 must be drawn (if the 10 pile runs out, or through some dogma effects), the game ends immediately. In this case, each player’s current score is more important than achievements, as time has passed by their relevance. The player with the highest current score wins. If tied, most achievements wins. If still tied, the game is a draw.

> If Card says "I demand you return all the lowest cards in your score pile." What card values should the player affected by this dogma consider as lowest cards?

"Lowest cards" means "Lowest age". So if your pile has ages 1, 1, 2, 5, then you'd return the two 1's. If it has 3, 5, 9, 10, then you'd return the single age 3 card.

> Are tucked cards (yours and other players') public information? Can we look at other players tucked cards to check what happens if they splay?

You can look at your own tucked cards, but you can't look at other players tucked cards. 

----
Page 22

There are lots of pieces of information in Innovation flying around, and theoretically you could try and keep track of every last one of them. We don’t usually do this because we don’t find it very fun! Here are some hard rules about information:

- You may never look at the identity of normal achievement cards, even if you have achieved them.
- You can always look at the cards in your hand, score pile, and board (even if covered up).
- You can always count and see the value of cards in each supply pile, each hand, and each score pile.
  
With your group, you should decide whether the following should be public information:

- The identity of cards partially covered up on an opponent’s board.
- The quantity of cards in an unsplayed color on an opponent’s board.
  
Here, we play that neither is open information. But there is no wrong answer -- if you want to be able to check the status of every card in play, that’s your choice!

> When a card says "the highest card" and you have multiple highest cards, do you choose one or take all of them?

If it says "the highest card", the player holding the cards chooses. If it says "all the highest cards",they all go.

> I play a dogma effect and I have two factories. Someone else has two factories. The first effect is to splay right. Doing so gives me three factories. Since I am the active player and do the dogma first, does the other player share since when it comes their turn to do so, they no longer have equal number or higher?

Yes, they share. You count symbols at the time the dogma action was taken. You count up icons for demands / sharing before anybody executes any effect, and do not recount after each effect happens. Also, each effect is shared by eligible opponents before you execute it.

----
page 9

Each dogma effect is preceded by a small version of one of the six possible icons, indicating which is its featured icon. At the start of a Dogma action, each player counts how many of the featured icon they have on their board. Each player that has at least as many as you is eligible to share in the use of your innovation. They are also immune to its demand effects, if it has any.

[did-a-share-occur](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/569671/did-a-share-occur)

> Someone did an Alchemy action and I shared. I had an empty hand to begin with, I drew 2 cards (due to having 6 tower icons) but since one of them was red, I returned the 2 cards. Did nothing happen, so the player with Alchemy does not get a bonus Draw? Or is the fact that two cards that were on top of a supply pile... are now on the bottom, a "change" enough to give him a bonus Draw?

Yes, sharing did occur. While it might look like nothing changed, those two cards went from the top of a deck to the bottom of a deck. That's a change, any change in the game state that occurs due to the sharing players' actions will grant the extra draw.

> When claiming an age achievement, where does the card come from?

During the setup of the game, you randomly choose 1 card from each Age, 1-9, and set it aside for the achievements. These cards are kept on a separate splay and cannot be viewed so you never know which cards have been pulled out. The rule book says "Without looking, draw one base card from each supply pile of ages 1-9, and place them in the center as normal Achievements."

The Deluxe rules on SCORE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENTS section says "Special achievements can be claimed at any time, even in the middle of an effect, or during another player’s turn. If you meet the conditions for one of them, take it immediately."

Yes, you have the rule correct. You and your opponents do as much as you can of each effect remembering that 'you may' effects are optional.

Draw a card into your hand from the supply pile matching the highest value among your top cards. Any time you try and draw a card from an empty supply pile, draw from the next available higher pile. For example, if your highest top card is a 4, and there are no 4, 5, or 6 cards to be drawn, you would draw a 7. If your board is empty, draw a 1. You may not choose to draw a card from a lower pile than your highest top card with a Draw action.

> if I want to splay the deck in a different direction, do I splay all the cards in the deck in that new direction? or only have my top card splayed while the bottom ones are tucked no matter how many cards were splayed?

When you splay a pile, you splay all the cards in that pile so that the appropriate number of icons (left = 1, right = 2, up = 3) are showing on each card. When you meld onto or tuck under a splayed pile, you continue the splay.

Yes they are worth 10 points. The number in the circle is an aid for how many points you need to claim an achievement from that age.

[shared-dogma-bonus-draw-what-age-to-draw-from](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1378432/shared-dogma-bonus-draw-what-age-to-draw-from)

> If I have a bonus draw from a shared dogma, do I draw from the age stack I was eligible for at the start of the dogma (as applies to the symbol count for sharing/demand purposes), or from the stack indicated by my current highest top card after executing the dogma?

The rules say, "If one or more opponents shared non-demand effects during the dogma action, you get a single free Draw action afterwards." The key points are that it is a Draw action (not just a draw of a card) and that it occurs after the dogma action. It is just as if the dogma action were your first action of your turn and then you chose a Draw action as your second action - except that this one is "free" and doesn't count as one of your two allotted actions. As with any Draw action, you determine the level to draw based on your highest top card at the beginning of the Draw action - not at the beginning of the dogma action that earned you the Draw action.

> if the dogma says that your opponent draws a 6 card you may draw a 7 card and there are no 6 or 7 cards in play do we both draw from the 8?

Yes. In regard to Vacinnation, anyone that shares the Dogma will also draw a 7 (which also becomes an 8) and in that case, you would also draw an extra card (based on your highest Age in play) after the Dogma completes.

> If I used Currency and returned 2 level 1 cards. If the level 2 stack was empty, and there was 1 level 3 card and plenty of level 4 cards. Am I supposed to get 4 points total that I could just take & score a level 4 card? or must I draw & score 2 level 2 cards, but since that stack is empty must I apply the draw higher rule and draw & score the level 3 card, then also 1 level 4 card, since the 3 stack was also empty at that point?

Follow the instructions on the cards as strictly as possible. Don't try to shortcut it. Nothing will ever tell you to score a number of points; you will only ever be told to score some card or cards. You try to draw & score a 2. If you cannot you go higher ... draw & score a 3. If you cannot you go higher.

Those numbers stand for the amount of points you must have (in addition to having a card of the same age on your board) to claim the achievement.

> If I demand something of another player and they have more than one thing (like a top card) that meets the criteria, who chooses which thing (card) is affected by the dogma? Me or the target player?

The targeted player decides. The cards state "I demand you..." so I'm forcing you to do something and as long as you do that something (in whatever manner you choose), the demand is satisfied.

> Evolution: "You may choose to either draw and score an [8] and then return a card from your score pile, or draw a card of value one higher than the highest card in your score pile."
> In our game, the second option above meant coincidentally that the player was entitled to draw an [8] i.e. the highest card in his scoring pile was a [7].
> Since in either case the player would be drawing the top card from the Age 8 pile, could he draw it first, look at it, and then determine which of the two options he would ultimately select whether to score that 8, or put it into his hand, or he has to state his intention, prior to seeing the card.

Nothing anywhere states or implies that he would get to peek at the 8 pile and then choose. The fact that the second option gives an 8 is a coincidence. You definitely have to decide which option you're taking before you do anything else.

> The card reads as follows: "I demand you transfer a card with a (lightbulb) higher than my top card of the same color from your board to my board! If you do, draw a 5 !" Which cards are eligible for transfer. The original wording referred to top cards. This one just refers to a card with a lightbulb, but does not specify that it has to be a top card. Does that mean you can select any card from anywhere in a pile? Would that card have to be visible?

The card in the middle of your stack isn't really in your board, available to be taken. Ony the top cards are eligible for transfer.

Did anyone share anything? If so draw one card.

Dogma effects are mandatory unless they say 'You may'.

> Can a non-phasing player instantly win, because he was sharing ahead of the phasing player? Or, do we need to fully finish out the action, creating a tie situation?

Yes instant win. There is no tie rule for achievement wins, and a person sharing an effect explicitly resolves before the person who activated the dogma.

 You draw only one bonus card at the end of the action.
 
> Democracy: When you use the dogma for second time in the same turn as your second action, do you consider the highest returned card count from the previous action or not?

It means only the current action. If Democracy is used again this same turn, it only looks at new cards returned as a result of the new dogma effect.

>  It only mentions in the rules that for drawing purposes you go to the next higher valued supply piles, but do you carry out the rest of the instructions on the dogma with these cards? If a card says "Draw a 2 card and score it". If there are no 2's left in the supply, I would draw the 3, but do I score it also?

You do carry out the rest of the instructions with the card you draw, no matter what age it comes from. The rule book says "Draw and ______: Many dogma effects instruct you to draw and tuck, draw and meld, or draw and score a card. In any of these cases, you must tuck, meld, or score the exact card drawn. You may not substitute a card you already had in your hand. Remember that if a supply pile is empty and you try and draw from it, you draw from the next available higher pile instead. If a dogma effect instructs you to take a card of a specific value from a place other than a supply pile and there is no card of that value, you do not take a card."

[mandatory](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/623769/mandatory)

If you have a card with 2 dogmas and one of them is impossible, eg: Meld a card of a New color (but you have all colors already), can you still use the 2nd power? Or does "mandatory" mean you have to be able to do all parts of the dogma to use the card?

Yes, you just do as much of the dogma(s) as you can.

Per the rules, you can look at anything except the achievement cards. Those remain secret. You can look at your own score pile and melds. You can never look at anyone's achievements or other players score piles or melds, though you can see the backs of the score pile (which often comes up).

Quote: "If you have ten or more green cards on your board, you win." Is a card required to be visible to count as "on your board"? In other words, if you have a stack of ten or more green cards, but they are not splayed, do you still win?

Your green stack does not have to be splayed to win with this card. Cards are part of your board even if they're not visible at all.

This card is powered up once Age 1, 2, 3 are empty. Return a single 3 or 4 (or whatever the lowest current age is) and then draw and score it back.

> when I return cards from my hands, do they go to the top or buttom of the supply deck?

If Player A has 2 leaves, Player C has 6. Does player C win?

Yes, the player with six leaves wins. If the dogma effect had read "If any player has less than three leaves and you have more leaves than anyone else, then you win." then the restriction to "for yourself only" would prevent any other player from executing that dogma effect and winning. But because the wording is "If any player has less than three leaves and any player has more leaves than anyone else, then you win." then, despite the fact that only you are executing the effect, any player can win.

> Is it correct, that the difference between "tuck" and "meld" is, that when I tuck cards, I place them to the bottom of the corresponding pile and while melding I`m placing them on the top of that pile?

Yes, when you tuck cards, place them to the bottom of the corresponding pile and while melding place them on the top of that pile.

> Does the action "tuck" also implement a "splay" ? In other words: Everytime, that I tuck a card, I have to splay the pile in one direction?

No. You would, however, continue an existing splay (but from the bottom). You only splay due to a dogma effect.

> How does splay work when you add more cards to a stack?
> Option A: Pile is splayed already, you add a card directly on top or tuck a card directly to the bottom of the pile. (The previous Top Card's icons are not visible, but the rest of the splay icons remain revealed.)
> Option B: Pile is splayed already, you add a card to the splay (the previous top card's icons are partially visible, or the tucked card's icons are partially visible.)
> Option C: Pile is unsplayed when a card is added or tucked (only the top card's icons are visible)

Option B. A pile is always either splayed or not splayed, it can't have some cards splayed and some not. And when you add a card to a splayed pile, it continues the splay.

Whoever actually did the transfer, namely your opponent, your opponent draws a 1 as compensation for you taking their card. For cards like this, it often helps to read the card out loud to your opponent.

> When counting icons do you add the icon on the left of the Title when counting? For example in the rule book it shows a sample card layout of the Computers card. Does that card have one or two clock icons counted assuming it is on top of the stack.

Yes, you count the icon on the left of the Title. Each card has 4 icons (one being a throw away theme hexagon).

In my 2 player game it quickly became a runaway situation where I was able to amass a huge score and undermine my opponents ability to score at the same time quickly giving me the stron lead and in essence, the win.

No limit, you can use the dogma on the card twice a turn for as many turns as you like. There are many situations that set up a player to score every turn. Just remember the rule that you must be at a certain tech level before you can achievement that level's score achievement. Also, especially in a 2 player game, one must be wary not to let the other player get too far ahead in icons, lest they walk all over you pulling off such dogma combos for too long.

> What is the point of the special achievement cards? I can't find anything that says the score any points at end game if it actually goes to points. Do they count towards the number of achievements that you need to win the game?

The special achievement cards count toward your achievement count which count as the primary win condition (ie For a 2 player game, the game ends at 6 achievements including your score and your special achievements). If the game ends via someone needing to draw a level 11+ card, then you only care about points in your score pile and all achievements are ignored.

[how-do-you-claim-achievements](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/905506/how-do-you-claim-achievements)

> How do you claim achievements?

At the beginning of the game, you lay out 1 card each from ages 1-9 in the middle of the table. These are used as the achievements and nothing else for this game.
To claim the 1 achievement, you must have:
- 5 or more points in your score pile
- a 1 or higher as a top card somewhere on your board
  
You then take the 1 card from those that you laid out at the beginning of the game. The game's 10 piles of cards (that you draw from) do not enter into it.
