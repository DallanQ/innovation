> Can you dogma a splayed card that is not the top card?

No, you can only dogma top cards.
You can only target the top card of each color with a Dogma action.

[translation-dogma](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3301705/translation-dogma)

> The 1st dogma says "You may meld all the cards in your score pile. If you meld one, you must meld them all."
2nd dogma says "If each top card on your board has a (crown icon), claim the World achievement". If I choose not to meld at all using the top dogma since it says "may" can I still use the 2nd dogma? Or since I didn't meld any cards using the 1st dogma am I out of luck using #2?

Unless noted otherwise, the dogmas are independent of each other. You can still activate the 2nd dogma even if you didn't meld anything from your score pile.

> On Gunpowder the second action starts with "If any card etc."
On Feudalism the second action starts with "You may etc".
Does this mean on Gunpowder the second action is shared by all players who have the required symbols and on Feudalism the second action only applies to the player that played the card since the action starts with "you"?

They're both shared. All non-demand dogma effects are shared by players that match the initiator's symbol count.

A dogma action is taken to its completion under the board state at the start of the action, which means covering doesn't matter, and players who share the first part can share any additional parts even if their icon count changes. From the rules "Finally, in the occasion the card you selected with the dogma action is covered up or removed during part of the action, you still complete all effects on the card."

In the case where there are multiple top non-purple cards with crowns on the opponents board, who chooses which one to transfer -- the demander or the demander's opponent?

The victim Chooses. "I demand YOU transfer" means your opponent is doing the transfer and they chooses whichever card to transfer.

"Lowest cards" means "Lowest age". So if your pile has ages 1, 1, 2, 5, then you'd return the two 1's. If it has 3, 5, 9, 10, then you'd return the single age 3 card.

If it says "the highest card", the player holding the cards chooses. If it says "all the highest cards",they all go.

Since I am the active player and do the dogma first, does the other player share since when it comes their turn to do so, they no longer have equal number or higher?

Yes, they share. You count symbols at the time the dogma action was taken. You count up icons for demands / sharing before anybody executes any effect, and do not recount after each effect happens. Also, each effect is shared by eligible opponents before you execute it.

Did nothing happen, so the player with Alchemy does not get a bonus Draw? Or is the fact that two cards that were on top of a supply pile... are now on the bottom, a "change" enough to give him a bonus Draw?

Yes, sharing did occur. While it might look like nothing changed, those two cards went from the top of a deck to the bottom of a deck. That's a change, any change in the game state that occurs due to the sharing players' actions will grant the extra draw.

> When claiming an age achievement, where does the card come from?

During the setup of the game, you randomly choose 1 card from each Age, 1-9, and set it aside for the achievements. These cards are kept on a separate splay and cannot be viewed so you never know which cards have been pulled out. The rule book says "Without looking, draw one base card from each supply pile of ages 1-9, and place them in the center as normal Achievements."

Player 2 uses the dogma action for The Internet, and the third effect "Draw and Meld a 10 for every two [clock] on your board" would cause Player 2 to draw four 10s. Does Player 2 draw and meld each card one at a time, allowing a Special Achievement such as World or Universe to be claimed before the game would end by drawing from an empty 10 pile?

The Deluxe rules on SCORE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENTS section says "Special achievements can be claimed at any time, even in the middle of an effect, or during another player’s turn. If you meet the conditions for one of them, take it immediately."

If I can't meet the requirement of the first dogma (because my hand is empty), can I still activate the card on my turn to take advantage of the second dogma (draw and score a 1 for each color present on your board...)? Is the rule that, if I chose to apply a dogma action to a card, I must execute any and all effects for which I'm eligible (and so must other eligible players in the case of shared dogmas), unless the card text specifies "you may". But by the same token I may deliberately pick a card to activate even though I am not eligible for one of the featured effects?

Yes, you have the rule correct. You and your opponents do as much as you can of each effect remembering that 'you may' effects are optional.

Draw a card into your hand from the supply pile matching the highest value among your top cards. Any time you try and draw a card from an empty supply pile, draw from the next available higher pile. For example, if your highest top card is a 4, and there are no 4, 5, or 6 cards to be drawn, you would draw a 7. If your board is empty, draw a 1. You may not choose to draw a card from a lower pile than your highest top card with a Draw action.

With an exchange, each player chooses an appropriate qualifying card(s) from their hand/score pile. So yes, you can pick which one you give away.

If you have two cards splayed, then add one, they three cards are splayed, and if you remove one the remaining two are still splayed. If you have a splayed pile of two cards, remove one and then add one, it is unsplayed.

In the rules, it points out that a single card pile is never considered splayed, so even if you have an effect that splays a yellow pile in a direction, unless there's more than one card, the splay never takes effect.
