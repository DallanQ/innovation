> Can you dogma a splayed card that is not the top card?

No, you can only dogma top cards.
You can only target the top card of each color with a Dogma action.

> The 1st dogma says "You may meld all the cards in your score pile. If you meld one, you must meld them all."
2nd dogma says "If each top card on your board has a (crown icon), claim the World achievement". If I choose not to meld at all using the top dogma since it says "may" can I still use the 2nd dogma? Or since I didn't meld any cards using the 1st dogma am I out of luck using #2?

Unless noted otherwise, the dogmas are independent of each other. You can still activate the 2nd dogma even if you didn't meld anything from your score pile.

> On Gunpowder the second action starts with "If any card etc."

Does this mean on Gunpowder the second action is shared by all players who have the required symbols and on Feudalism the second action only applies to the player that played the card since the action starts with "you"?

They're both shared. All non-demand dogma effects are shared by players that match the initiator's symbol count.

A dogma action is taken to its completion under the board state at the start of the action, which means covering doesn't matter, and players who share the first part can share any additional parts even if their icon count changes. From the rules "Finally, in the occasion the card you selected with the dogma action is covered up or removed during part of the action, you still complete all effects on the card."

> what happens if someone gets a final achievement in the middle of the actions? Does the game end then, or does it continue until the end of that players turn?

The (standard) game end is that the person who gets the 4/5/6-th achievement wins. Regular achievements can only be claimed as an action, so clearly there's no problem with these. Special achievements are claimed IMMEDIATELY (even if the matching condition is transient.
For example: you're melding multiple cards and you reach the condition after melding one, and the lose the condition after melding the second, you still get to claim the special achievement)
So, as soon as you have the appropriate number of achievements, you win.

"Lowest cards" means "Lowest age". So if your pile has ages 1, 1, 2, 5, then you'd return the two 1's. If it has 3, 5, 9, 10, then you'd return the single age 3 card.

Yes, they share. You count symbols at the time the dogma action was taken. You count up icons for demands / sharing before anybody executes any effect, and do not recount after each effect happens. Also, each effect is shared by eligible opponents before you execute it.

Did nothing happen, so the player with Alchemy does not get a bonus Draw? Or is the fact that two cards that were on top of a supply pile... are now on the bottom, a "change" enough to give him a bonus Draw?

Yes, sharing did occur. While it might look like nothing changed, those two cards went from the top of a deck to the bottom of a deck. That's a change, any change in the game state that occurs due to the sharing players' actions will grant the extra draw.

During the setup of the game, you randomly choose 1 card from each Age, 1-9, and set it aside for the achievements. These cards are kept on a separate splay and cannot be viewed so you never know which cards have been pulled out. The rule book says "Without looking, draw one base card from each supply pile of ages 1-9, and place them in the center as normal Achievements."

Does Player 2 draw and meld each card one at a time, allowing a Special Achievement such as World or Universe to be claimed before the game would end by drawing from an empty 10 pile?

The Deluxe rules on SCORE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENTS section says "Special achievements can be claimed at any time, even in the middle of an effect, or during another player’s turn. If you meet the conditions for one of them, take it immediately."

Is the rule that, if I chose to apply a dogma action to a card, I must execute any and all effects for which I'm eligible (and so must other eligible players in the case of shared dogmas), unless the card text specifies "you may". But by the same token I may deliberately pick a card to activate even though I am not eligible for one of the featured effects?

Yes, you have the rule correct. You and your opponents do as much as you can of each effect remembering that 'you may' effects are optional.

If you have two cards splayed, then add one, they three cards are splayed, and if you remove one the remaining two are still splayed. If you have a splayed pile of two cards, remove one and then add one, it is unsplayed.

You fan out the cards in the direction indicated. If it says to splay your cards right, take the top card, and push it 1 inch to the right. This will expose two icons (or one and a hexagon, on some cards). Continue fanning out the cards so that the left 1 inch of each card under the top one is exposed.

In the rules, it points out that a single card pile is never considered splayed, so even if you have an effect that splays a yellow pile in a direction, unless there's more than one card, the splay never takes effect.

The rules say, "If one or more opponents shared non-demand effects during the dogma action, you get a single free Draw action afterwards." The key points are that it is a Draw action (not just a draw of a card) and that it occurs after the dogma action. It is just as if the dogma action were your first action of your turn and then you chose a Draw action as your second action - except that this one is "free" and doesn't count as one of your two allotted actions. As with any Draw action, you determine the level to draw based on your highest top card at the beginning of the Draw action - not at the beginning of the dogma action that earned you the Draw action.

Your opponent gives you two cards, and you give your opponent one.

> Evolution: "You may choose to either draw and score an [8] and then return a card from your score pile, or draw a card of value one higher than the highest card in your score pile."
> In our game, the second option above meant coincidentally that the player was entitled to draw an [8] i.e. the highest card in his scoring pile was a [7].
> Since in either case the player would be drawing the top card from the Age 8 pile, could he draw it first, look at it, and then determine which of the two options he would ultimately select whether to score that 8, or put it into his hand, or he has to state his intention, prior to seeing the card.

Nothing anywhere states or implies that he would get to peek at the 8 pile and then choose. The fact that the second option gives an 8 is a coincidence. You definitely have to decide which option you're taking before you do anything else.

>  I have a card with two effects (each with an icon).
> Does the first effect go around the table, then I draw one, if anyone else used it. Then the second effect goes around and I draw another card if anyone uses it?
> So two questions:
> 1) Are the effects of the first icon resolved, then the second?

The order is:

First effect - share, then do yourself.
Second effect - share, then do yourself.
Did anyone share anything? If so draw one card.

> If a player has as many or more icons than the player on turn selecting a dogma, must the other players perform the (non-may) dogma or is it their option?

Dogma effects are mandatory unless they say 'You may'.

> Can a non-phasing player instantly win, because he was sharing ahead of the phasing player? Or, do we need to fully finish out the action, creating a tie situation?

Yes instant win. There is no tie rule for achievement wins, and a person sharing an effect explicitly resolves before the person who activated the dogma.

> When you share more then one non-demand effect in one unique dogma action (using a card with multiple non-demand effects), do you draw only one bonus card at the end of the action, or do you draw one card for/after each shared effect?

 You draw only one bonus card at the end of the action.
 
> Democracy: When you use the dogma for second time in the same turn as your second action, do you consider the highest returned card count from the previous action or not?
In other words, does "phase" means the hole turn, or does it mean only the action?

It means only the current action. If Democracy is used again this same turn, it only looks at new cards returned as a result of the new dogma effect.

>  It only mentions in the rules that for drawing purposes you go to the next higher valued supply piles, but do you carry out the rest of the instructions on the dogma with these cards? If a card says "Draw a 2 card and score it". If there are no 2's left in the supply, I would draw the 3, but do I score it also?

You do carry out the rest of the instructions with the card you draw, no matter what age it comes from. The rule book says "Draw and ______: Many dogma effects instruct you to draw and tuck, draw and meld, or draw and score a card. In any of these cases, you must tuck, meld, or score the exact card drawn. You may not substitute a card you already had in your hand. Remember that if a supply pile is empty and you try and draw from it, you draw from the next available higher pile instead. If a dogma effect instructs you to take a card of a specific value from a place other than a supply pile and there is no card of that value, you do not take a card."

[mandatory](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/623769/mandatory)

> The rules claim that all parts of a dogma are mandatory. If you have a card with 2 dogmas and one of them is impossible, eg: Meld a card of a New color (but you have all colors already), can you still use the 2nd power? Or does "mandatory" mean you have to be able to do all parts of the dogma to use the card?

Yes, you just do as much of the dogma(s) as you can.

> What can you look at? Can you peek at your tucked cards, and can you peek at your score pile, even though they're scored face down?

Per the rules, you can look at anything except the achievement cards. Those remain secret. You can look at your own score pile and melds. You can never look at anyone's achievements or other players score piles or melds, though you can see the backs of the score pile (which often comes up).

[winning-with-collaboration](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/556818/winning-with-collaboration)

> The second dogma effect of Collaboration is
Quote: "If you have ten or more green cards on your board, you win." Is a card required to be visible to count as "on your board"? In other words, if you have a stack of ten or more green cards, but they are not splayed, do you still win?

Your green stack does not have to be splayed to win with this card. Cards are part of your board even if they're not visible at all.

This card is powered up once Age 1, 2, 3 are empty. Return a single 3 or 4 (or whatever the lowest current age is) and then draw and score it back.

> when I return cards from my hands, do they go to the top or buttom of the supply deck?

Returned cards go to the bottom of the supply decks.

> If player A Plays computer and activates the dogma thereupon.

If Player A has 2 leaves, Player C has 6. Does player C win?

Yes, the player with six leaves wins. If the dogma effect had read "If any player has less than three leaves and you have more leaves than anyone else, then you win." then the restriction to "for yourself only" would prevent any other player from executing that dogma effect and winning. But because the wording is "If any player has less than three leaves and any player has more leaves than anyone else, then you win." then, despite the fact that only you are executing the effect, any player can win.

[difference-between-tuck-and-meld](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/550007/difference-between-tuck-and-meld)

> Is it correct, that the difference between "tuck" and "meld" is, that when I tuck cards, I place them to the bottom of the corresponding pile and while melding I`m placing them on the top of that pile?

Yes, when you tuck cards, place them to the bottom of the corresponding pile and while melding place them on the top of that pile.

> Does the action "tuck" also implement a "splay" ? In other words: Everytime, that I tuck a card, I have to splay the pile in one direction?

No. You would, however, continue an existing splay (but from the bottom). You only splay due to a dogma effect.

[splaying-a-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/611014/splaying-a-question)

> How does splay work when you add more cards to a stack?
> Option A: Pile is splayed already, you add a card directly on top or tuck a card directly to the bottom of the pile. (The previous Top Card's icons are not visible, but the rest of the splay icons remain revealed.)
> Option B: Pile is splayed already, you add a card to the splay (the previous top card's icons are partially visible, or the tucked card's icons are partially visible.)
> Option C: Pile is unsplayed when a card is added or tucked (only the top card's icons are visible)

Option B. A pile is always either splayed or not splayed, it can't have some cards splayed and some not. And when you add a card to a splayed pile, it continues the splay.

[dogma-effect](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1413269/dogma-effect)

> When a demand-dogma says (for instance City States)"transfer a top card from your board to my board. If you do, draw a 1"......
Who is addressed by you and may draw a 1? My opponent or me?

Whoever actually did the transfer, namely your opponent, your opponent draws a 1 as compensation for you taking their card. For cards like this, it often helps to read the card out loud to your opponent.

[first-play-rules-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/611773/first-play-rules-questions)

> When counting icons do you add the icon on the left of the Title when counting? For example in the rule book it shows a sample card layout of the Computers card. Does that card have one or two clock icons counted assuming it is on top of the stack.

Yes, you count the icon on the left of the Title. Each card has 4 icons (one being a throw away theme hexagon).

> In regards to the following 2 cards,
> Navigation (I Demand you transfer a 2 or 3 from your score pile to my score pile)
> Machine Tools(Draw and score a card of value equal to the highest card in your score pile)
> Could a player just play those 2 cards again and again turn after turn racking up a good score by stealing and scoring cards? Is there no limit on the number of times in a row a card may be used? In my 2 player game it quickly became a runaway situation where I was able to amass a huge score and undermine my opponents ability to score at the same time quickly giving me the stron lead and in essence, the win.

No limit, you can use the dogma on the card twice a turn for as many turns as you like. There are many situations that set up a player to score every turn. Just remember the rule that you must be at a certain tech level before you can achievement that level's score achievement. Also, especially in a 2 player game, one must be wary not to let the other player get too far ahead in icons, lest they walk all over you pulling off such dogma combos for too long.

> What is the point of the special achievement cards? I can't find anything that says the score any points at end game if it actually goes to points. Do they count towards the number of achievements that you need to win the game?

The special achievement cards count toward your achievement count which count as the primary win condition (ie For a 2 player game, the game ends at 6 achievements including your score and your special achievements). If the game ends via someone needing to draw a level 11+ card, then you only care about points in your score pile and all achievements are ignored.
